---- INSTRUCTION TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM ----

In order to run the program first, you need to confirm the UID and GID of your UNIX system
For that open a bash and run the command id.

example:
run:      id
(output)  uid=1000(pedro) gid=1000(pedro) groups=1000(pedro),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)

In this example, the UID and the GID are 1000.
Now open the passwd file, and in the third and seventh field write the uid and gid that you found (running the command id)

Each entry of the passwd file contains the following fields:

username:encrypted_password:UID:SALT:No_failed_attemps:Password_age:GID:comments:home_directory:shellcode
example:
user1:FPmadrB54AAfg:1000:FP:0:0:1000:USERname1:/home/user1:/bin/sh


The valid usernames and the respective correct passwords are
  -username   :   password  (with the dot)
  - user1     :   user1.
  - user2     :   user2.
  - user3     :   user3.
  - user4     :   user4.
  - user5     :   user5.


To compile the program open the terminal in the same directory where the file are save and run the command make.
After that run the command ./project and the execution will start.


The system will start and then you can write the username.
After that you can entry the password.
If the username and the password are correct a new shell will start.
